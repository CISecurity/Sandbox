OVAL Proposal Form
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The OVAL Proposal Form is used by members of the community to prepare proposals 
for migration into an official release of OVAL. The form will be critical in 
helping the members of the community understand, review, and vet proposals.

Once an OVAL Proposal Form is submitted to the oval-developer-list, the OVAL 
Moderator will review and verify the proposal for completeness at which point 
it will be ready for community review and discussion. 

When a new proposal is introduced to the community, the OVAL Moderator will 
work with the OVAL Board to determine the impact of the proposal. If the 
proposal is deemed a high impact change, it must be developed in the OVAL 
Sandbox which will require the completion of this form as well as an OVAL 
Board vote before it is migrated into an official release. More information 
about the OVAL Board Voting Process can be found at [1]. If the proposal is 
deemed a low impact change, the proposed change can be made directly to an 
official OVAL release.

Please direct any questions or concerns to MITRE at oval@mitre.org.

Introduction to Proposal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) What is the new capability?

The OVAL schemas for Apple iOS provide a standards-based capability to check 
Apple iOS device configuration.

2) Why is the new capability needed?

The Apple iOS OVAL schemas are needed to provide a standards-based capability 
to check Apple iOS device configuration.  

3) What is the version of the targeted official OVAL release?

The targeted OVAL version for this proposal is OVAL 5.11.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benefits of Proposal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) How does the proposal relate to existing OVAL use cases [4]?
The tests provide capabilities to express and assess Apple iOS device 
configuration for the following OVAL use cases: 

* Configuration Management

2) What does this proposal enable that cannot currently be accomplished in the 
OVAL Language?

The OVAL Language does not currently include any Apple iOS-specific schemas.  

The OVAL SQL tests could potentially be used to query device state information 
held by a mobile device management system, but such an approach is not desired 
because it would require creating customized SQL tests for each particular 
mobile device management product, and because the storage mechanisms of each 
mobile device management product are often proprietary.
 
The proposed Apple iOS schema provides the ability to check:
* Global restrictions in place on the device
* Passcode policy in place on the device
* Configuration Profiles installed on the device

3) What alternative approaches for supporting these use cases were considered 
and why is this one the best?

OVAL SQL tests are an alternative approach, but for the reasons stated above 
we do not believe that is the optimal approach.

Numerous mobile device management products exist today that provide the 
ability to assess Apple iOS device configuration.  However, there is currently 
no standards-based mechanism to:
* Input to these products the compliance checks to perform, or 
* Output compliance results to be ingested by other enterprise security systems.

Another alternative approach is for the OVAL Apple iOS schema to solely check 
the installed configuration profiles, because if an enterprise's configuration 
profile is installed, they can be assured that the profile's security policies 
(or better) are being enforced.  We have two concerns with this approach:
* This approach doesn't provide a standard mechanism to analyze and report on 
the actual security policies in place on the device.
* It was unclear to us whether we could reliably determine that an installed 
configuration profile is in fact the enterprise's profile (as opposed to a 
fake profile asserting the same identifiers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Impacts of Proposal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Which existing OVAL schemas are affected by this proposal?  

None.

2) Does the proposal break backward compatibility with previous versions?  
Please see OVAL Versioning Policy [5] for more information.

This proposal does not break backward compatibility.  

2) How will the proposed changes impact OVAL content authors?

This will provide OVAL content authors with the ability to create new 
content based on the new tests.  We have created proof-of-concept OVAL 
definitions demonstrating the ability to automate useful compliance checks.  

3) How will the proposed changes impact OVAL content consumers?

No impact to current OVAL content consumers.  These changes will provide 
an opportunity to use OVAL to create Apple iOS configuration management 
content.

4) How will the proposed changes impact existing OVAL content?

No impact.

5) How will the proposed changes impact existing OVAL implementations?

The impact will depend on whether the existing OVAL implementations need to 
implement Apple iOS-specific schema features.  In many cases it will not be 
necessary.

If mobile device management products choose to implement OVAL support, they
will need to add the capability to parse Apple iOS OVAL definitions and 
assess gathered mobile device state information against the definitions.  
Mobile device management systems typically already include the ability to 
gather device state information, but they will need to ensure they are 
collecting the particular information used by the Apple iOS OVAL schema.

6) Are there any concerns regarding this proposal (e.g., undocumented APIs, 
etc.)? If so, are there any mitigating factors?  

We used information from Apple's public Configuration Profile Key Reference 
to create the OVAL schemas.
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/Introduction/Introduction.html 

Apple's proprietary mobile device management protocol is the only supported 
interface to gather this information from Apple iOS devices.  We don't 
believe this is a concern because the OVAL schemas themselves abstract the 
details of how the device state information is gathered.  We expect that 
commercial mobile device management vendors are already partnering with 
Apple and have access to their proprietary protocol.  

OVAL provides a standards-based mechanism to assess the information gathered 
by the mobile device management systems and share the compliance results.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical Review
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Do the schema changes follow the accepted naming and design conventions?

Yes.

2) Do the schema changes satisfy the requirements specified in the Requesting 
Changes to the OVAL Language page [3]?

Yes.

3) Do the schema changes align with the targeted official release (e.g., changes 
that break backward compatibility should not target a minor release)? Please 
see the OVAL Versioning Policy [5] for more information.

Yes.

4) Have the new capabilities been successfully implemented and tested with sample 
content?

Yes.
