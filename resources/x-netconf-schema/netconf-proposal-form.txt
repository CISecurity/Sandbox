OVAL Proposal Form
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The OVAL Proposal Form is used by members of the community to prepare proposals for 
migration into an official release of OVAL. The form will be critical in helping the 
members of the community understand, review, and vet proposals.

Once an OVAL Proposal Form is submitted to the oval-developer-list, the OVAL 
Moderator will review and verify the proposal for completeness at which point it will 
be ready for community review and discussion. 

When a new proposal is introduced to the community, the OVAL Moderator will work with 
the OVAL Board to determine the impact of the proposal. If the proposal is deemed a 
high impact change, it must be developed in the OVAL Sandbox which will require the 
completion of this form as well as an OVAL Board vote before it is migrated into an 
official release. More information about the OVAL Board Voting Process can be found 
at [1]. If the proposal is deemed a low impact change, the proposed change can be 
made directly to an official OVAL release.

Please direct any questions or concerns to MITRE at oval@mitre.org.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps to Take
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Review the OVAL Language Sandbox page [2] and the Requesting Changes to the OVAL 
   Language page [3].

2) Complete the form provided below.

3) Email the completed form to the oval-developer-list at 
   oval-developer-list@lists.mitre.org with a subject of 
   "FOR REVIEW: <Proposal Name> Proposal Form".

4) Revise the proposal, as needed, based on community discussion and feedback.

Introduction to Proposal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) What is the new capability?

The new NETCONF schema provides the ability to assess the configuration of network
devices that support the NETCONF protocol.

2) Why is the new capability needed?

OVAL currently only supports a limited number of network devices (Cisco IOS, CatOS, and PixOS), 
however, a number of network devices support NETCONF.  This capability will allow for the
assessment of any network device that supports NETCONF while specific platform extensions are 
developed for these unsupported network devices.

3) What is the version of the targeted official OVAL release?

5.11

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benefits of Proposal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) How does the proposal relate to existing OVAL use cases [4]?

This new schema provides capabilities to support the following OVAL use cases:

  * Security Advisory Distribution
  * Vulnerability Assessment
  * Configuration Management

2) What does this proposal enable that cannot currently be accomplished in the OVAL 
   Language?

This test enables the configuration assessment of network devices that support NETCONF, that
do not currently have their own extensions in the OVAL Language.
   
3) What alternative approaches for supporting these use cases were considered and 
   why is this one the best?
   
NETCONF makes it possible to express a device configuration in the form of an XML document.
It is possible to construct complex filters for a NETCONF/get-config request, to restrict the scope
of information returned.  But, we felt that supporting an unfiltered get-config request via OVAL
would be simpler.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Impacts of Proposal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Which existing OVAL schemas are affected by this proposal?  If a new platform 
   schema is being proposed, is it expected to inherit tests from another schema (e.g.
   UNIX-based platform schemas typically inherit tests from the UNIX schema)? 

No, the NETCONF schema is not expected to inherit tests from another platform schema.
   
2) Does the proposal break backward compatibility with previous versions?  Please 
   see OVAL Versioning Policy [5] for more information.

This proposal does not break backward compatibility with previous versions of OVAL.
   
2) How will the proposed changes impact OVAL content authors?

This will have a positive impact for OVAL content authors since they will be able to
create new content for network devices that support NETCONF.

3) How will the proposed changes impact OVAL content consumers?

The new capabilities will have a positive impact for OVAL content consumers as they
will be able to download content for network devices that support NETCONF.

4) How will the proposed changes impact existing OVAL content?

There should not be any impact to existing content.

5) How will the proposed changes impact existing OVAL implementations?

The impact is that existing OVAL tools will need to implement the new capabilities in
their tools if the proposal is accepted into the OVAL Language and they choose to
support it.

6) Are there any concerns regarding this proposal (e.g., undocumented APIs, etc.)? 
   If so, are there any mitigating factors?
  
Some concerns have been expressed that this schema requires the collection of data
using a particular protocol or mechanism.  But this is not necessarily the case, particularly
because the schema does not support NETCONF filtering.  A device's XML configuration
data could be collected by a variety of different means, this test merely requires that data
be formatted as a NETCONF/get-config response message.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical Review
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Do the schema changes follow the accepted naming and design conventions?

Yes.

2) Do the schema changes satisfy the requirements specified in the Requesting Changes 
   to the OVAL Language page [3]?

Yes.
   
3) Do the schema changes align with the targeted official release (e.g., changes that 
   break backward compatibility should not target a minor release)? Please see the 
   OVAL Versioning Policy [5] for more information.

Yes.
   
4) Have the new capabilities been successfully implemented and tested with sample 
   content?

Yes, in jOVAL (http://joval.org/features/juniper/ and http://joval.org/features/cisco-ios/).
