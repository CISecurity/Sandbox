OVAL Proposal Form
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The OVAL Proposal Form is used by members of the community to prepare proposals for 
migration into an official release of OVAL. The form will be critical in helping the 
members of the community understand, review, and vet proposals.

Once an OVAL Proposal Form is submitted to the oval-developer-list, the OVAL 
Moderator will review and verify the proposal for completeness at which point it will 
be ready for community review and discussion. 

When a new proposal is introduced to the community, the OVAL Moderator will work with 
the OVAL Board to determine the impact of the proposal. If the proposal is deemed a 
high impact change, it must be developed in the OVAL Sandbox which will require the 
completion of this form as well as an OVAL Board vote before it is migrated into an 
official release. More information about the OVAL Board Voting Process can be found 
at [1]. If the proposal is deemed a low impact change, the proposed change can be 
made directly to an official OVAL release.

Please direct any questions or concerns to MITRE at oval@mitre.org.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps to Take
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Review the OVAL Language Sandbox page [2] and the Requesting Changes to the OVAL 
   Language page [3].

2) Complete the form provided below.

3) Email the completed form to the oval-developer-list at 
   oval-developer-list@lists.mitre.org with a subject of 
   "FOR REVIEW: <Proposal Name> Proposal Form".

4) Revise the proposal, as needed, based on community discussion and feedback.

Introduction to Proposal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) What is the new capability?

The new Juniper JunOS platform schema provides various new capabilities needed to
assess the configuration of network devices running Juniper JunOS.  Specifically, this
proposal includes tests for checking XML configuration files, the output of the SHOW
command, the version of a JunOS operating system, and the output of the XML SHOW command.

A new value (junos) should also be added to the EntityState[Family/Item]Type.

2) Why is the new capability needed?

OVAL does not currently support the assessment of Juniper JunOS network devices.  This
platform schema would provide the capabilties to support this assessment.

3) What is the version of the targeted official OVAL release?

5.11

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benefits of Proposal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) How does the proposal relate to existing OVAL use cases [4]?

This new platform schema provides capabilities to support the following OVAL use cases:

  * Security Advisory Distribution
  * Vulnerability Assessment
  * Configuration Management

2) What does this proposal enable that cannot currently be accomplished in the OVAL 
   Language?
   
The new tests will address limitations in the checking capabilities of Juniper JunOS
network devices.  Previously, there was no way to directly assess Juniper JunOS devices and
their configuration states.  Now content authors and tools will be able to assess Juniper
JunOS network devices by examining the output of the various SHOW commands supported
by the OS, as well as parsed version information.

3) What alternative approaches for supporting these use cases were considered and 
   why is this one the best?
   
We considered repurposing some of the Cisco IOS tests for use against Juniper devices.  But, it is
not possible to leverage the built-in XML capabilities of JunOS using this approach, and it is also
considered to be very useful to have a pre-parsed version information available for the simplicity
it offers in constructing vulnerability-related definitions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Impacts of Proposal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Which existing OVAL schemas are affected by this proposal?  If a new platform 
   schema is being proposed, is it expected to inherit tests from another schema (e.g.
   UNIX-based platform schemas typically inherit tests from the UNIX schema)? 

None (apart from the family type in the independent schema).  The Juniper JunOS platform
schema is not expected to inherit tests from another platform schema.

2) Does the proposal break backward compatibility with previous versions?  Please 
   see OVAL Versioning Policy [5] for more information.

This proposal does not break backward compatibility with previous versions of OVAL.
   
2) How will the proposed changes impact OVAL content authors?

This will have a positive impact for OVAL content authors since they will be able to
create content for Juniper JunOS network devices using the new tests.

3) How will the proposed changes impact OVAL content consumers?

The new capabilities will have a positive impact for OVAL content consumers as they
will be able to download content for Juniper JunOS network devices.

4) How will the proposed changes impact existing OVAL content?

There should not be any impact to existing known content.  If any private content was created
using existing tests, to check Juniper JunOS network devices, that content should probably be
upgraded to use the new tests.

5) How will the proposed changes impact existing OVAL implementations?

The impact is that existing OVAL tools will need to implement the new capabilities in
their tools if the proposal is accepted into the OVAL Language and they choose to
support it.

6) Are there any concerns regarding this proposal (e.g., undocumented APIs, etc.)? 
   If so, are there any mitigating factors?

No concerns have been brought to the attention of the community.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical Review
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Do the schema changes follow the accepted naming and design conventions?

Yes.

2) Do the schema changes satisfy the requirements specified in the Requesting Changes 
   to the OVAL Language page [3]?

Yes.
   
3) Do the schema changes align with the targeted official release (e.g., changes that 
   break backward compatibility should not target a minor release)? Please see the 
   OVAL Versioning Policy [5] for more information.
   
Yes.

4) Have the new capabilities been successfully implemented and tested with sample 
   content?
   
Yes, in jOVAL (http://joval.org/features/juniper/).
